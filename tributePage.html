         Sukarno[a] (/suːˈkɑːrnoʊ/;[2] born Koesno Sosrodihardjo, Javanese: [kʊsnɔ]; 6 June 1901 – 21 June 1970)[3] was an Indonesian statesman, orator, revolutionary, and nationalist who was the first president of Indonesia, serving from 1945 to 1967.<br><br>

         Sukarno was the leader of the Indonesian struggle for independence from the Dutch colonialists. He was a prominent leader of Indonesia's nationalist movement during the colonial period and spent over a decade under Dutch detention until released by the invading Japanese forces in World War II. Sukarno and his fellow nationalists collaborated to garner support for the Japanese war effort from the population, in exchange for Japanese aid in spreading nationalist ideas. Upon Japanese surrender, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945, and Sukarno was appointed as its president. He led Indonesians in resisting Dutch re-colonisation efforts via diplomatic and military means until the Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence in 1949. Author Pramoedya Ananta Toer once wrote, "Sukarno was the only Asian leader of the modern era able to unify people of such differing ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds without shedding a drop of blood."[4]

         After a chaotic period of parliamentary democracy, Sukarno established an autocratic system called "Guided Democracy" in 1959 that successfully ended the instability and rebellions which were threatening the survival of the diverse and fractious country. The early 1960s saw Sukarno veering Indonesia to the left by providing support and protection to the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) to the irritation of the military and Islamists. He also embarked on a series of aggressive foreign policies under the rubric of anti-imperialism, with aid from the Soviet Union and China. After the events surrounding the 30 September Movement of 1965, the military general Suharto largely took control of the country and destroyed the PKI with executions of its members and sympathisers in several massacres, with support from the CIA[5] and British intelligence services,[6] resulting in an estimated 500,000 to over 1,000,000 deaths.[7][8][9][10] In 1967, Suharto assumed the presidency, replacing Sukarno, who remained under house arrest until his death in 1970.
